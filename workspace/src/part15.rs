// The derived `Clone` implementation will clone the `Arc`, so all clones will actually talk about
// the same counter.

impl ConcurrentCounter {
    // The constructor just wraps the constructors of `Arc` and `Mutex`.
    pub fn new(val: usize) -> Self {
        unimplemented!()
    }

    // The core operation is, of course, `increment`.
    pub fn increment(&self, by: usize) {
        // `lock` on a mutex returns a guard, very much like `RefCell`. The guard gives access to
        // the data contained in the mutex.
        let mut counter = self.0.lock().unwrap();
        *counter = *counter + by;
    }

    // The function `get` returns the current value of the counter.
    pub fn get(&self) -> usize {
        unimplemented!()
    }
}

// Now our counter is ready for action.
pub fn main() {
    let counter = ConcurrentCounter::new(0);

    // We clone the counter for the first thread, which increments it by 2 every 15ms.
    let counter1 = counter.clone();
    let handle1 = thread::spawn(move || {
        for _ in 0..10 {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(15));

    let counter2 = counter.clone();
    let handle2 = thread::spawn(move || {
        for _ in 0..10 {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(20));
            counter2.increment(3);
        }
    });

    // Now we watch the threads working on the counter.
    for _ in 0..50 {
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(5));
        println!("Current value: {}", counter.get());
    }

    // Finally, we wait for all the threads to finish to be sure we can catch the counter's final
    // value.
    handle1.join().unwrap();
    handle2.join().unwrap();
    println!("Final value: {}", counter.get());
}

// **Exercise 15.1**: Add an operation `compare_and_inc(&self, test: usize, by: usize)` that
// increments the counter by `by` *only if* the current value is `test`.
// 
// **Exercise 15.2**: Rather than panicking in case the lock is poisoned, we can use `into_inner`
// on the error to recover the data inside the lock. Change the code above to do that. Try using
// `unwrap_or_else` for this job.


// **Exercise 15.3**:  Change the code above to use `RwLock`, such that multiple calls to `get` can
// be executed at the same time.
